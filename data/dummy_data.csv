An intelligent and independent mind, his whole appearance one of dignity and style. To his own he is devoted and loyal with a charming and lively personality. The Afghan Hound is an athlete capable of immense speed and requires a large fenced in yard and exercise daily.Since ancient times, Afghan Hounds have been famous for their elegant beauty. But the thick, silky, flowing coat that is the breed’s crowning glory isn’t just for show — it served as protection from the harsh climate in mountainous regions where Afghans originally earned their keep. Beneath the Afghan’s glamorous exterior is a powerful, agile hound — standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder — built for a long day’s hunt.

Alaskan Malamute,"The Alaskan Malamute stands 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 85 pounds. Everything about Mals suggests their origin as an arctic sled dog: The heavy bone, deep chest, powerful shoulders, and dense, weatherproof coat all scream, “I work hard for a living!” But their almond-shaped brown eyes have an affectionate sparkle, suggesting Mals enjoy snuggling with their humans when the workday is done.

American Staffordshire Terrier,"AmStaffs are stocky, muscular bull-type terriers standing 17 to 19 inches at the shoulder. The head is broad, the jaws well defined, the cheekbones pronounced, and the dark, round eyes are set wide apart. AmStaff movement is agile and graceful, with a springy gait that advertises the breed’s innate confidence. The stiff, glossy coat comes in many colors and patterns. AmStaffers describe their dogs as keenly aware of their surroundings, game for anything, and lovable “personality dogs” around the house. AmStaffs like mental and physical challenges. They are highly trainable, as their many forays into showbiz suggest. When acquiring an AmStaff, there’s only one way to go: Do your homework and find a responsible AKC breeder.

American Water Spaniel,"American Water Spaniels are muscular midsize gundogs, not flashy in looks or performance, and recognizable by a luscious brown coat that is either tightly curled or wavy. Bred to work the icy waters and marshy banks of the Great Lakes region, these spaniels are ideally outfitted for the job: The coat is dense and waterproof, the feet are thickly padded, the toes are webbed, and the body is small enough for the dog to hop in and out of a skiff without rocking the boat. The breed’s admirers describe a merry, intelligent, and versatile spaniel suited to a variety of dog sports. As hunters, they combine the working traits of spaniels and retrievers.

The head may have a black mask and there may be white markings on the legs, bib and at the tip of tail. There are no color or marking disqualifications in the breed.

Azawakh,"This ancient hunting hound is so lean and rangy that his bone structure and musculature can plainly be seen beneath his skin. The smooth S-shaped contours, deep chest, and aerodynamic head mark the Azwakh as a member of the sighthound family, canine sprinters that rely on keen vision and blazing speed to fix and course their prey. The ultrafine coat comes in several colors and patterns. The overall look of this leggy hound is one of elegance and fineness, but don’t be fooled: This is a tough, durable hunter who’s been chasing gazelle across the scorching sands of the Sahara for more than a thousand years. Tall and elegant, the Azawakh is a West African sighthound who originates from the countries of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. The Azawakh has a short, fine coat which may come in any color or color combinations: red, clear sand to fawn, brindled, parti-color (which may be predominantly white), blue, black and brown. The head may have a black mask and there may be white markings on the legs, bib and at the tip of tail. There are no color or marking disqualifications in the breed.

Bearded Collie,"Standing 20 to 22 inches at the shoulder and covered head to tail in a shaggy double coat, Beardies bear a passing resemblance to another British favorite, the Old English Sheepdog. Beneath the coats, Beardies are the more lean and angular of the two. The lavish facial hair shouldn’t obscure the characteristic expression: a dreamy, faraway gaze.These rambunctious comics can be a handful—but mostly, Beardies are approximately 50 pounds of heart, energy, and laughter. Well-socialized Beardies will get on nicely with other animals and kids. They bore easily, and training must be kept interesting.

Beauceron,"Beaucerons are muscular, rugged, and large, standing as high as 27.5 inches at the shoulder, and yet graceful and in all ways balanced. Their dark black coats feature handsome squirrel-red accents, including the red feet that give the breed its French nickname Bas-Rouge (“red stockings”). They’re also seen in a black-gray-tan coat.

Bluetick Coonhound,"Blueticks are speedy and compact nocturnal hunters named for the mottled (or “ticked”) black-and-blue pattern of the glossy coat.

The baying, bawling, and chopping bark of Blueticks might be cacophonous to some, but to coon hunters it’s the music of the night.The droopy-eared charm of Blueticks is irresistible.

Bostons are no exception: they are sturdy but portable, people-oriented, and always up for a brisk walk to the park or outdoor cafe. A bright dog with a natural gift for comedy, the dapper Bostonian is a steady source of smiles. The Boston Terrier is a lively little companion recognized by his tight tuxedo jacket, sporty but compact body, and the friendly glow in his big, round eyes. His impeccable manners have earned him the nickname “The American Gentleman.”","Friendly, Bright, Amusing",21,46.91982041990442,54.277499752568666,22.130707523685995,30.5795603460514,20.04473335719525,15.428650669229295,Non-Sporting Group,0.2804533769806218,Weekly Brushing,0.022096607863100304,Seasonal,0.008906188896548262,Energetic,0.025625495269537057,Independent,0.743479640278735,Reserved with Strangers

Brussels Griffon,"With this breed, you get a big personality in a 5-to-15-pound package. One look into his big, human-like eyes, and you’ll be smitten. Griffs come in four colors—red, black-and-reddish-brown (called belge), black and tan, and black—and in smooth coats (like a Pug) or rough coats (like a Schnauzer). Their black muzzle and whiskers earned them the nickname “bearded dogs” in old folk songs.The Griff’s big black eyes—described as “almost human”—coupled with a fringed beard and mustache covering his short muzzle, gives him the air of a worldly, French-speaking philosopher. The Griff’s body is thickset and sturdy, and he moves with the purposeful trot of a fellow who knows what he wants.Griffs are alert, sociable, and easily trained. Although playful and energetic, their small size and sensitive nature make them a poor choice as roughhousing playmates for kids.

Bull Terrier,"Bull Terriers are robust, big-boned terriers who move with a jaunty stride suggesting agility and power. The breed’s hallmark is a long, egg-shaped head with erect and pointed ears, and small, triangular eyes that glisten with good humor. Coats come in two types: white; and any other color (including an attractive brindle striping), either solid or with white markings. A well-made BT is the picture of muscular determination and balance. There are four keys to BT happiness: early socialization with dogs and people; firm but loving training; ample exercise; and lots of quality time with his adored humans. If these requirements are met, there is no more loyal, lovable, and entertaining companion.

Canaan Dog,"Canaan Dogs are lean, bushy-tailed dogs standing 19 to 24 inches at the shoulder. The coat is straight and harsh, and comes in various colors and patterns. Erect, expressive ears and dark almond eyes convey an inquisitive expression. Canaans move at a brisk, natural trot. They are rugged, agile, and apparently tireless, making them a nice fit for hikers and runners.Canaans are clever, confident, and territorial. They will end up “owning” passive owners who haven’t establish themselves as top dog in the family pack. Early training and socialization are key.

Chihuahua,"The Chihuahua is a balanced, graceful dog of terrier-like demeanor, weighing no more than 6 pounds. The rounded “apple” head is a breed hallmark. The erect ears and full, luminous eyes are acutely expressive. Coats come in many colors and patterns, and can be long or short. The varieties are identical except for coat.Chihuahuas possess loyalty, charm, and big-dog attitude. Even tiny dogs require training, and without it this clever scamp will rule your household like a little Napoleon. Compact and confident, Chihuahuas are ideal city pets.

Chinese Crested,"The Chinese Crested, a lively and alert toy breed standing between 11 and 13 inches high, can be hairless or coated.

Besides the coat, there’s very little difference between the powderpuff and his undressed brother. Both varieties are characterized by fine-boned elegance and graceful movement.Cresteds are as fun as they look: playful, loving, and devoted to their humans. The hairless has its advantages: there is no doggy odor, and for obvious reasons shedding isn’t much of a problem. Both varieties are attentive housemates, totally in tune with their family.

The large, upright ears point up the alert expression of the eyes, whose amber or ochre color smartly complements the coat.In many ways, these lithe and leggy Sicilians are typical sighthounds: sweet-natured, independent and, of course, breathtakingly swift. It is said, though, that Cirnechi are a bit more trainable than the usual sighthound. These living artifacts of antiquity have sprinted into the 21st century relatively unchanged by passing fads and fancies. The sleek and sinewy Cirneco dell’Etna, the ancient coursing hound of Sicily, is an athletic hunter given to quick bursts of speed. As housedogs, Cirnechi are mild, low-maintenance companions cherished for their loyal and gentle nature.","Affectionate, Friendly, Independent",183,57.655981439519195,68.46187589346292,8.4866375054284,30.324589018751176,19.48121499389657,21.396320683017777,Hound Group,0.1879809404514191,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.7482614870150646,Regularly,0.5260096534324148,Regular Exercise,0.0996810840186888,Agreeable,0.03406485617680688,Outgoing

Dachshund,"The word “icon” is terribly overworked, but the Dachshund—with his unmistakable long-backed body, little legs, and big personality—is truly an icon of purebred dogdom. Dachshunds can be standard-sized (usually 16 to 32 pounds) or miniature (11 pounds or under), and come in one of three coat types: smooth, wirehaired, or longhaired.Dachshunds aren’t built for distance running, leaping, or strenuous swimming, but otherwise these tireless hounds are game for anything.

English Setter,"English Setters are elegant but solid dogs of beauty and charm. The word “belton,” unique to the breed, describes the speckled coat patterns of colors that sound good enough to eat: liver, lemon, and orange among them. Under the showy coat is a well-balanced hunter standing about 25 inches at the shoulder.A graceful neck carries a long, oval-shaped head proudly, and dark brown eyes convey a soft expression.

German Wirehaired Pointer,"Standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder, GWPs are a bit taller and heavier than their close relative, the German Shorthaired Pointer. GWPs are balanced, well muscled, resilient, agile, and generally built to beat the bushes all day long without tiring. The harsh wire coat protects against thorny underbrush and foul weather, and the shaggy beard and eyebrows complete an intelligent, worldly expression.“The need for running in the great outdoors is a must!” says one veteran owner. “This breed will not be happy to be on the couch all day.” GWPs are bright and eager, but their independent, inquisitive nature might frustrate novice owners.

Glen of Imaal Terrier,"Glens are scruffy, sturdy, low-slung terriers standing no more than 14 inches at the shoulder. There’s nothing fancy or fussed-over about Glens.Rather, their wiry no-frills coat, broad head, and bowed front legs suggest a working farm dog from a time and place where substance was more important than style.

Golden Retriever,"The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a “merry action.”The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth’s great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations.Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes. The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America’s most popular dog breeds. They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work.","Friendly, Intelligent, Devoted",3,69.0642511735671,65.30499781016755,33.103824016644985,44.64777315885434,11.755090903193954,14.49206536262779,Sporting Group,0.642244457414135,Daily Brushing,0.6125454073257912,Frequent,0.06174128294659076,Needs Lots of Activity,0.18241137682258146,Easy Training,0.333879018991317,Alert/Responsive

Great Dane,"As tall as 32 inches at the shoulder, Danes tower over most other dogs—and when standing on their hind legs, they are taller than most people. These powerful giants are the picture of elegance and balance, with the smooth and easy stride of born noblemen. The coat comes in different colors and patterns, perhaps the best-known being the black-and-white patchwork pattern known as “harlequin.”Despite their sweet nature, Danes are alert home guardians. Just the sight of these gentle giants is usually enough to make intruders think twice. But those foolish enough to mistake the breed’s friendliness for softness will meet a powerful foe of true courage and spirit. Patient with kids, Danes are people pleasers who make friends easily. The easygoing Great Dane, the mighty “Apollo of Dogs,” is a total joy to live with—but owning a dog of such imposing size, weight, and strength is a commitment not to be entered into lightly.

Harrier,"Somewhat resembling a Beagle with a gym membership, Harriers are larger, more powerful hounds than their diminutive cousin—but smaller than the English Foxhound, a breed used in their development.

Keeshond,"These square, sturdy companions descend from the same ancient stock as other spitz types, such as Pomeranians and Samoyeds. Typically “spitzy,” Keeshonden have a foxy face, pointed ears, an abundant coat, and a plumed tail carried high over the back.

Mastiff,"For the uninitiated, a face-to-face encounter with these black-masked giants can be startling. A male stands at least 30 inches at the shoulder and can outweigh many a full-grown man. The rectangular body is deep and thickly muscled, covered by a short double coat of fawn, apricot, or brindle stripes. The head is broad and massive, and a wrinkled forehead accentuates an alert, kindly expression. Mastiffs are patient, lovable companions and guardians who take best to gentle training. Eternally loyal Mastiffs are protective of family, and a natural wariness of strangers makes early training and socialization essential. Mastiffs are magnificent pets, but acquiring a powerful giant-breed dog is commitment not to be taken lightly. The colossal Mastiff belongs to a canine clan as ancient as civilization itself.

Norfolk Terrier,"Norfolk Terriers are among the smallest working terriers, standing no higher than 10 inches at the shoulder. The coat is hard, wiry, and straight. They share many traits with their close cousins, Norwich Terriers. To tell them apart, look at the ears: The Norwich has erect, pointed ears; Norfolk ears are neatly folded over.Bred to work in packs, Norfolks are more gregarious than a typical terrier, but they have plenty of the old terrier pep.

They can be pint-sized like Pomeranians, mighty like Malamutes, or mid-sized like the lithe but sturdy Buhund. Males can stand 18.5 inches high and weight up to 40 pounds. Coat colors are wheaten or black. The densely coated Norwegian Buhund, a Nordic spitz-type closely associated with the Vikings, is a medium-sized cold-weather worker adept at herding and guarding. As family dogs, Buhunds are smart, affectionate, and steadfastly devoted.","Confident, Smart, Perceptive",165,51.96355985619798,60.382464708515656,18.319051486578722,29.460960009116107,14.622236656270575,19.966667569917615,Herding Group,0.4110719370697624,Specialty/Professional,0.8534225329665552,Seasonal,0.3871108264099028,Calm,0.5953193617748967,May be Stubborn,0.09671201899607251,Friendly

Otterhound,"These big, bouncy hounds were ideally suited for otter hunting. OHs are built to be expert swimmers, from the top of their rough, waterproof coat to the bottom of their big webbed feet. A broad chest and powerful shoulders allow them to swim all day without tiring. Their large black nose is amazingly sensitive and could follow an otter’s underwater scent trail over great distances.

Papillon,"A tiny dog, measuring 8 to 11 inches at the shoulder, you can still spot a Papillon a block away thanks to the large, wing-shaped ears that give the breed its name (“papillon” is French for “butterfly”). Some Paps have erect ears; in others, known as the Phalene type, the ears are down. Paps are dainty and elegant, with a plumed tail, and a long, silky coat of several color combinations, the base color being white. More robust than they look, Paps are little dogs for all seasons and reasons. They thrive in warm or cool climates, in town or country, and are eager to join family fun. They are excellent agility dogs and are consistent winners at the sport’s highest levels; less ambitious owners can train them to do all kinds of tricks.

They come in only one color – wheaten – which spans every shade seen in a wheat field, from pale flaxen to the burnished red of a maturing crop. Ridgebacks also have two nose colors: black and the less commonly seen brown.The formidable Ridgeback can be strong willed, independent, and sometimes domineering. Ridgebacks must be guided with a firm but fair hand from puppyhood. They are faithful friends, protective of their loved ones and meltingly affectionate with those whom they trust. Still, a Ridgeback can be too much hound for the novice dog owner. The Rhodesian Ridgeback is an all-purpose “Renaissance hound” whose hallmark is the ridge, or stripe of backward-growing hair, on his back. Though the breed was made famous in its native Africa for its skill at tracking and baying – but never, ever killing – lions, today Ridgebacks are cherished family dogs whose owners must be prepared to deal with their independence and strong prey drive.","Affectionate, Dignified, Even-Tempered",41,63.919067585776936,84.61687500998579,49.45254580778034,49.41121954268268,14.646464568664737,15.643782524223916,Hound Group,0.38932879296589673,Weekly Brushing,0.939859588326108,Frequent,0.9160363879542733,Calm,0.3817785440678434,May be Stubborn,0.18377776657745248,Friendly

Scottish Terrier,"The well-known Scottie silhouette is that of a short-legged but substantial terrier with distinctive furnishings at the beard, legs, and lower body. The wiry topcoat and soft, dense undercoat coat can be black, wheaten yellow, or a brindle-stripe pattern. Bright, piercing eyes, and erect ears and tail, convey keen alertness—a hallmark of Britain’s terrier breeds.The Scottie working style has been described as efficient and businesslike, and their aloofness toward strangers makes them excellent watchdogs. Their hunting instinct remains strong, which can complicate life for the neighbor’s cat, and Scotties are known to be cantankerous around other dogs.

Sealyham Terrier,"Standing less than 11 inches at the shoulder and weighing about 24 pounds, Sealys are not big enough to be considered medium-sized dogs, but they stand among the strongest and most substantial of what we think of as small dogs.A typical Sealy is well-muscled, built low to ground, and moves easily with long, determined strides. The weatherproof coat is predominantly white, and a long, broad head is furnished with lavish facial hair. Despite their rep as the bruiser among short-legged terriers, Sealys are cute, funny, affectionate, outgoing, and trainable, if a bit stubborn.

Siberian Husky,"The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky’s almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue—and sometimes one of each—and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. In fact, breeders and fanciers prefer the moniker Siberians over huskies, as the latter suggests a bigger, brawnier dog than what is the standard for the breed.As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; their innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. This breed is also energetic and can’t resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Siberians are naturally clean, with little doggy odor. The Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses.

Whippets like a fenced yard to run in, but they do nicely in cozy apartments too—as long as they are exercised properly. Another plus for city dwellers: Whippets rarely bark.
